# Graphs.Graphs.Graphs.Graphs.Graphs.

Font size:
•	Titles and axis should be different sizes
•	Size could mean importance (i.e. Main title is the biggest size, axis title > labels)

Colour scheme:
•	Use neutral colours (blue and grey usually works well)
•	Use minimal number of colours (too many colours usually make it hard to understand graphs) 
•	Different colours are usually associated with different categories categorical variables/discrete values)
•	Gradient of colours is a thing
•	Green = good, Red=bad/ Blue = good, Orange = bad
•	Which one are you trying to divert attention to (maybe use a different colour /bolder colour?)
•	Background colour can make graphs harder to read (I prefer white)

Ordering/Highlight objects
•	Grid lines are not always needed – i.e. if you just want to highlight the pattern rather than letting people read the numbers
•	Ordering bars from highest to lowest or vice versa make them easier to understand (if that’s your purpose for using them) – a lot of tools default to alphabetical for categorical variables
•	Putting legends next to lines makes them easier to read
•	Pushing everything to the background and then highlighting your story is quite a good method of creating graphs
•	Axis labels is good practice but can remove obvious ones like dates

Dashboard:
•	Alignment of axis
•	White space between graphs
•	Consistency

Tips
•	Get someone else’s opinion 
•	Main question: Where are your eyes drawn to when looking at the graph
•	Get away from it and look again (for fresh set of eyes, looking at a graph too much means you can miss obvious things)
•	Simple graphs are easier to read hence your audience will understand it easier
•	Line charts, bar graphs, maps are my favourite
